        "Citizen science has become a powerful force for scientific inquiry, providing researchers with access to a vast array of",
        "data points while connecting non scientists to the real process of science. This citizen-researcher relationship",
        "creates a very interesting synergy, allowing for the creation, execution, and analysis of research projects. ",
        "With this in mind, a Convolutional Neural Network has been trained to identify phytoplankton in collaboration",
        "with the [Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee](http://www.vliz.be/).\n",

        "This Docker container contains a trained Convolutional Neural network optimized for phytoplankton identification using",
        "images. The architecture used is an Xception [1] network using Keras on top of Tensorflow.\n",

        "The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with ",
        "the top 5 predictions.\n",

        "As training dataset we have used a collection of images from the [Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee](http://www.vliz.be/)",
        "which consists of around 650K images from 60 classes of phytoplankton.\n",
